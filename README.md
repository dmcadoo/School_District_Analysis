# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose

### The purpsoe of this challeneg was to manipulate the data in order to see if the evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We also provided the follwoing data metrics:

### The district summary
### The school summary
### The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
### The average math score for each grade level from each school
### The average reading score for each grade level from each school
### The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

## Data Analysis

### After summarizing the data, both district summaries from pycityschools and pycityschools_challenge there is not a change. The over all passing for Thomas High School was 90.94%, with the 9th graders taken out the overall passing decreases 0.3 %. This was accompliehsed by repalcng  9th graders values with NAN who attended Thomas High School.

### Thomas High School scores remain statisaclly similair and the other statistics for Overall passing percentage and school type reflect this.


## Conclusion
### Replacing the 9th grader scores did not reveal any academic dishonetly compared to other schools or in relation to any spending statistics.
